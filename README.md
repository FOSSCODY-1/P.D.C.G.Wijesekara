Graph implementation

Description

Implementation of simple graph with the functions BFS and DFS. 
This JAVA implementation uses adjacency list representation of graphs

Installation

This graph implementation can be installed and run in any java platform.
Here I have used Netbeans as my development platform.

contributing

This project can be extended to develop the applications of DFS and BFS.
For example, 
-Finding Strongle Connected Components(DFS)
-Topological sorting(DFS)
-Bipartite graph(Both BFS and DFS)
-Broadcasting in networks(BFS)
