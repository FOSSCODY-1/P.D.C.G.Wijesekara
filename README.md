### Project Title
Graph implementation

### Description

\> Implementation of simple directed graph using java programming language.\
\> This JAVA implementation uses adjacency list representation of graphs.\
\> Basic functionalities of a directed graph implemented :  
  * Insertion of vertex and an edge.  
  * Deletion of a vertex and an edge.  
  * Breadth First Search traversal.  
  * Deapth First Search traversal.  
  * Display the graph
  
### Set up and Installation

\>  Download the GraphImplementation folder as a zip file.<br/>
\>  Extract it and compile the GraphImplementation.java file.<br/>
\>  Run the executable file using any java platform.<br/>

### Instructions to use

\> Insert the number of vertices as user input. (A linked list array will be created starting form the index 0 up to the number of vertices minus one.<br/>
\> Insert edges using option 1.
  * input : 1 3<br/>
  This will add vertex 3 to vertex 1's list, representing an edge between 1-->3<br/>
\> After Implementing the Graph required functions can be called.<br/>

### Support 

This program will support for any Java platform.
